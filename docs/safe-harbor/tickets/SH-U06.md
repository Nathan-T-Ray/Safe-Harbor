# SH-U06 — Build candidate conclusions and comparison cards

**Lane:** UI
**Dependencies:** [SH-U01](https://github.com/Nathan-T-Ray/Safe-Harbor/blob/main/docs/safe-harbor/tickets/SH-U01.md), [SH-R11](https://github.com/Nathan-T-Ray/Safe-Harbor/blob/main/docs/safe-harbor/tickets/SH-R11.md)
**Proposed file scope:** `frontend/src/safe-harbor/App.tsx`

## Work

Show criterion status, endpoint support, freshness and the most consequential unresolved question. Keep workflow progress separate from scientific interpretation.

## Acceptance criteria

A viewer understands the current conclusion without reading genomic tracks. No unexplained safety score or fake precision appears.

## Required handoff

- Changed paths and commit/PR.
- What now works.
- Actual acceptance evidence.
- Remaining limitations.
- Next dependent ticket and owner.

## Shared boundaries

**NO UNIT TESTS. NO COMPONENT TESTS. E2E ONLY.** Build/type/syntax/schema/data-integrity checks are allowed. Use real coordinates, sequence, annotations and source tables. No fabricated biology, model runs or improvements. Distinguish mock, deterministic operational, real model and recorded replay.

Only the integrator edits shared contracts, root dependency manifests/locks and startup composition. Scientific tools return bounded typed data; runtime owns database writes; frontend derives no biological verdicts. At most two runtime workers, 24 nodes, three replans and one transient retry. Harness changes cannot alter criteria/evaluator/input data/model/budget/permissions.
