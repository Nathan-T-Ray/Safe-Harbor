# SH-D05 — Implement deterministic genomic calculations

**Lane:** Data
**Dependencies:** [SH-D01](https://github.com/Nathan-T-Ray/Safe-Harbor/blob/main/docs/safe-harbor/tickets/SH-D01.md), [SH-D04](https://github.com/Nathan-T-Ray/Safe-Harbor/blob/main/docs/safe-harbor/tickets/SH-D04.md)
**Proposed file scope:** `backend/safe_harbor/science/calculations.py`

## Work

Use Bioframe for overlap, nearest-feature and distance calculations. Handle strand when computing transcription-start positions. Record tool versions, parameters and input hashes.

## Acceptance criteria

A real candidate produces independently checkable numeric artifacts. No model performs interval arithmetic or invents eligibility thresholds.

## Required handoff

- Changed paths and commit/PR.
- What now works.
- Actual acceptance evidence.
- Remaining limitations.
- Next dependent ticket and owner.

## Shared boundaries

**NO UNIT TESTS. NO COMPONENT TESTS. E2E ONLY.** Build/type/syntax/schema/data-integrity checks are allowed. Use real coordinates, sequence, annotations and source tables. No fabricated biology, model runs or improvements. Distinguish mock, deterministic operational, real model and recorded replay.

Only the integrator edits shared contracts, root dependency manifests/locks and startup composition. Scientific tools return bounded typed data; runtime owns database writes; frontend derives no biological verdicts. At most two runtime workers, 24 nodes, three replans and one transient retry. Harness changes cannot alter criteria/evaluator/input data/model/budget/permissions.
