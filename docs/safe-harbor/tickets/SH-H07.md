# SH-H07 — Apply promotion rules and reuse the selected version

**Lane:** Harness / Evaluation
**Dependencies:** [SH-H06](https://github.com/Nathan-T-Ray/Safe-Harbor/blob/main/docs/safe-harbor/tickets/SH-H06.md)
**Proposed file scope:** `backend/safe_harbor/evaluation/promotion.py`

## Work

Use validation cases for selection. Require no correctness, support or coverage regression, plus a predefined measurable benefit. Preserve rejection when the change fails.

## Acceptance criteria

The decision is reproducible and a subsequent run uses the selected saved harness. Final evaluation remains outside selection.

## Required handoff

- Changed paths and commit/PR.
- What now works.
- Actual acceptance evidence.
- Remaining limitations.
- Next dependent ticket and owner.

## Shared boundaries

**NO UNIT TESTS. NO COMPONENT TESTS. E2E ONLY.** Build/type/syntax/schema/data-integrity checks are allowed. Use real coordinates, sequence, annotations and source tables. No fabricated biology, model runs or improvements. Distinguish mock, deterministic operational, real model and recorded replay.

Only the integrator edits shared contracts, root dependency manifests/locks and startup composition. Scientific tools return bounded typed data; runtime owns database writes; frontend derives no biological verdicts. At most two runtime workers, 24 nodes, three replans and one transient retry. Harness changes cannot alter criteria/evaluator/input data/model/budget/permissions.
