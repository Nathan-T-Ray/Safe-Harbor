# SH-Q08 — Prove replay equals committed state

**Lane:** E2E
**Dependencies:** [SH-U10](https://github.com/Nathan-T-Ray/Safe-Harbor/blob/main/docs/safe-harbor/tickets/SH-U10.md)
**Proposed file scope:** `e2e/safe_harbor/replay.mjs`

## Work

Start with an empty client, replay through a chosen watermark and compare the resulting entities with the backend snapshot.

## Acceptance criteria

Candidates, tasks, assessments, versions and totals agree. Repeated seeks remain deterministic.

## Required handoff

- Changed paths and commit/PR.
- What now works.
- Actual acceptance evidence.
- Remaining limitations.
- Next dependent ticket and owner.

## Shared boundaries

**NO UNIT TESTS. NO COMPONENT TESTS. E2E ONLY.** Build/type/syntax/schema/data-integrity checks are allowed. Use real coordinates, sequence, annotations and source tables. No fabricated biology, model runs or improvements. Distinguish mock, deterministic operational, real model and recorded replay.

Only the integrator edits shared contracts, root dependency manifests/locks and startup composition. Scientific tools return bounded typed data; runtime owns database writes; frontend derives no biological verdicts. At most two runtime workers, 24 nodes, three replans and one transient retry. Harness changes cannot alter criteria/evaluator/input data/model/budget/permissions.
