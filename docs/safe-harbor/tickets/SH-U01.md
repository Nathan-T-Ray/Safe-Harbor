# SH-U01 — Build the application shell and mode indicators

**Lane:** UI
**Dependencies:** [SH-F02](https://github.com/Nathan-T-Ray/Safe-Harbor/blob/main/docs/safe-harbor/tickets/SH-F02.md)
**Proposed file scope:** `frontend/src/safe-harbor/App.tsx`, `frontend/src/safe-harbor/styles.css`, `frontend/src/main.tsx`

## Work

Create the context bar, candidate rail, genome area, task graph area and evidence drawer. Build against labeled fixtures immediately.

## Acceptance criteria

Assembly, cell context, selected candidate and LIVE / RECORDED / MOCK status remain visible throughout navigation.

## Required handoff

- Changed paths and commit/PR.
- What now works.
- Actual acceptance evidence.
- Remaining limitations.
- Next dependent ticket and owner.

## Shared boundaries

**NO UNIT TESTS. NO COMPONENT TESTS. E2E ONLY.** Build/type/syntax/schema/data-integrity checks are allowed. Use real coordinates, sequence, annotations and source tables. No fabricated biology, model runs or improvements. Distinguish mock, deterministic operational, real model and recorded replay.

Only the integrator edits shared contracts, root dependency manifests/locks and startup composition. Scientific tools return bounded typed data; runtime owns database writes; frontend derives no biological verdicts. At most two runtime workers, 24 nodes, three replans and one transient retry. Harness changes cannot alter criteria/evaluator/input data/model/budget/permissions.
