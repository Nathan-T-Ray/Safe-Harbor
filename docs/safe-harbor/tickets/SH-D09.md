# SH-D09 — Freeze cases, grouping and evaluation splits

**Lane:** Evaluator
**Dependencies:** [SH-D08](https://github.com/Nathan-T-Ray/Safe-Harbor/blob/main/docs/safe-harbor/tickets/SH-D08.md)
**Proposed file scope:** `backend/safe_harbor/evaluation/cases.py`, `data/safe_harbor/evaluator/splits.json`

## Work

Target twelve audit cases, provisionally four development, four validation and four final. Keep related loci/scenario variants grouped; use a smaller feasible split if necessary.

## Acceptance criteria

Case definitions and split hashes are frozen before model comparisons. Disclose their shared-source nature.

## Required handoff

- Changed paths and commit/PR.
- What now works.
- Actual acceptance evidence.
- Remaining limitations.
- Next dependent ticket and owner.

## Shared boundaries

**NO UNIT TESTS. NO COMPONENT TESTS. E2E ONLY.** Build/type/syntax/schema/data-integrity checks are allowed. Use real coordinates, sequence, annotations and source tables. No fabricated biology, model runs or improvements. Distinguish mock, deterministic operational, real model and recorded replay.

Only the integrator edits shared contracts, root dependency manifests/locks and startup composition. Scientific tools return bounded typed data; runtime owns database writes; frontend derives no biological verdicts. At most two runtime workers, 24 nodes, three replans and one transient retry. Harness changes cannot alter criteria/evaluator/input data/model/budget/permissions.
