# SH-R11 — Produce versioned assessments and shortlists

**Lane:** Runtime
**Dependencies:** [SH-R10](https://github.com/Nathan-T-Ray/Safe-Harbor/blob/main/docs/safe-harbor/tickets/SH-R10.md), [SH-D01](https://github.com/Nathan-T-Ray/Safe-Harbor/blob/main/docs/safe-harbor/tickets/SH-D01.md)
**Proposed file scope:** `backend/safe_harbor/runtime/assessments.py`

## Work

Validate criterion-level outputs and evidence references. Aggregate using frozen rules. Separate current conclusions, unresolved questions and historical assessments.

## Acceptance criteria

A complete case and an insufficient-evidence case produce correct distinct states, visible in the API and export.

## Required handoff

- Changed paths and commit/PR.
- What now works.
- Actual acceptance evidence.
- Remaining limitations.
- Next dependent ticket and owner.

## Shared boundaries

**NO UNIT TESTS. NO COMPONENT TESTS. E2E ONLY.** Build/type/syntax/schema/data-integrity checks are allowed. Use real coordinates, sequence, annotations and source tables. No fabricated biology, model runs or improvements. Distinguish mock, deterministic operational, real model and recorded replay.

Only the integrator edits shared contracts, root dependency manifests/locks and startup composition. Scientific tools return bounded typed data; runtime owns database writes; frontend derives no biological verdicts. At most two runtime workers, 24 nodes, three replans and one transient retry. Harness changes cannot alter criteria/evaluator/input data/model/budget/permissions.
